      Today, I started this website. It was easier than I thought to get html
      working on VS code with js and css, but I eventually got it to work.
      Hopefully, as I do this I will be able to figure out how to use azure so
      people will one day be able to see this.

      Update: It's public! I ended up going with github instead of azure, as you 
      can see with the url. Or at least it should have the word github on it.
      Eventually I want to get my own custom domain but I don't even know where to start yet.
